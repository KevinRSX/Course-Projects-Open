      <h2>(m)</h2>
      <p>I use TWO kinds of position (And I think they are quite meaningful):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I use RELATIVE POSITION in all blocks (with id selector) and set all value to 0 so that I can give absolute position to everything inside the blocks.</li>
        <li>I use ABSOLUTE POSITION for menu items' headings (with pseudo class selector) so that their position will not change menu items are shown.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>(n)</h2>
      <p>I use FOUR kinds of CSS3 techniques:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Every block's (excluding header and footer) border is designed with ROUND CORNER.</li>
        <li>I use GRADIENT to design the background color of the header (linear change from orange to yellow).</li>
        <li>I use TRANSITION of background color of information and order block. Whenever they are hovered, the background color will change from white to some kind of light green</li>
        <li>I use ANIMATION in the promotion block to highlight it so that people are more likely to be attracted to it.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>(o)</h2>
      <p>My styles are grouped as follows</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All of my styles are link style.</li>
        <li>I created 4 stylesheets: default.css, homeDesign.css, orderDesign.css, and orderPrint.css</li>
        <li>defualt.css is in the upper level folder of all HTML files. It controls the styles of header and footer.</li>
        <li>homeDesign.css is grouped together with home.html. It controls the styles (information block and promotion block) of home page.</li>
        <li>orderDesign.css is grouped together with order.html. It controls the styles (menu block and order table block) of order page.</li>
        <li>orderPrint.css is grouped together with order.html. It shows the style when this page is printed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div><br>

    <div id="cw3">
      <h2>CW3 event handlers:</h2>
      <h3>A. Home Page</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(HTML event handler) To show a random promotion text on page load, I declared a function <span>promote()</span> and set the event handler onload in the body tag.</li>
        <li>(HTML event handler) To change the video when the playing is over, I declared a function <span>changeVideo()</span> and set the event handler onended in the corresponding video tag.</li>
        <li>(HTML event handler) To check input of the reservation form, I declared a function <span>checkForm()</span> and set the event handler onclick in the submission button.</li>
        <li>(JavaScript event handler) To cancel the event of clearing forms, I declared a function <span>checkCancel()</span> and set the event handler onclick in JavaScript codes by selecting the button in DOM</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>B. Home Page</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(HTML event handler) To create menu items by javascript corresponding to different buttons and the default setting, <br>
        on page load, I set event handler onload to call the function <span>displayImages("sushi")</span> as default the displayed menu pages. I also set eventhandlers onclick for all three menu titles to display different items.</li>
        <li>(JavaScript event handler) To add tablerows for each "add" button, I use DOM to select dynamic HTML elements created by JS and set onclick event handlers to call the function <span>addOrder()</span>.</li>
        <li>Other two functions <span>recal() and undo()</span> are not called by event handlers. They are invoked simply inside other functions automatically.</li>
      </ul>
