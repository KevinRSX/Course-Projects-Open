This repository contains all mini-projects or assignments from courses that I have taken.

Following items are not included:

- A complete software project, which contains proper documentations. It could be really useful for some people. (In this repository, the projects are mainly used to show what I have learnt and whether I can master it)
- Some assignments are banned from spreading as they might be used repeatedly for other students going too take the course. I won't put anything like that here to avoid plagiarism.
