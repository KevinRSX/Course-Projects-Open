The code part of this project contains two folders. As stated in the report, I wrote two different programs for basic and bonus part. To run the programs, `python3` is required.



The `basic` directory contains `TextMessenger_blocked.py` , which is the basic implementation that only supports two users and each of whom cannot send multiple messages. To run this program, get into this directory and type

```
python3 TextMessenger_blocked.py
```

in the terminal.



The `bonus` directory contains three files, `client.py`, `server.py` , and `__main__.py`, which implements the client functions, server functions, and the main program flow respectively. Since `__main__.py` is defined, to run this program, you should go to the parent directory `code-55199704/` to and type

```
python3 bonus
```

in the terminal.
